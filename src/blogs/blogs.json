Since I am into computer science, this will be my “Hello World” of blog posts. The posts I plan to put out will vary in terms of topics, and I hope to have a good flow of content to keep things interesting around here. If you have a request for a post, please email me. I am always open to suggestions! In the meantime, I will be working on the first real blog. See you when it drops!</p>"
